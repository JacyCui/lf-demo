# $\lambda_F$: The Core Calculus of Synchronized Firrtl

This is a quick prototype of $\lambda_F$ semantics, including

- A compiler of $\lambda_F$ circuit.
- A compiler of $\lambda_F$ script.
- An interpreter of $\lambda_F$ semantics.
- A demonstration example located at `src/test/java/pascal/lf/LFTest.java` .
